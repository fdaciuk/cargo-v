> An easy way to update the version of your package

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/fdaciuk/cargo-v)

## Install

```sh
cargo install cargo-v
```

## Usage

You can update the version of your project using the command:

```sh
cargo v patch
```

The above command will update the `patch` part of version from your `Cargo.toml`, 
it will run `cargo build` to update `Cargo.lock` file, and create a commit and 
a git tag with the new version, if you are using git.

You can use four options to update the version: `patch`, `minor`, `major` or a 
manually typed version (like `1.0.1`).

### patch

will change the latest number of version:

**Command:**

```sh
cargo v patch
```

**Update in Cargo.toml:**

```toml
[package]
name = "cargo-v"
version = "0.0.2"
#              ^ This number will be updated
```

### minor

will change the middle number of version:

**Command:**

```sh
cargo v minor
```

**Update in Cargo.toml:**

```toml
[package]
name = "cargo-v"
version = "0.1.0"
#            ^ This number will be updated
```

### major

will change the first number of version:

**Command:**

```sh
cargo v major
```

**Update in Cargo.toml:**

```toml
[package]
name = "cargo-v"
version = "1.0.0"
#          ^ This number will be updated
```

### manually typed version

will change the version with the exact entry:

**Command:**

```sh
cargo v 1.0.1
```

**Update in Cargo.toml:**

```toml
[package]
name = "cargo-v"
version = "1.0.1"
```
